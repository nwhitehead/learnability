# The Learnability Framework

General framework for extracting faithful behavioral models from arbitrary
observable systems via iterative dimension refinement. **This file imports
only Mathlib** — it is independent of `LTS.lean`, `ConditionalSimulation.lean`,
and `Convergence.lean`. The `behavior : State → Label → State → Prop` field
does not require an LTS interpretation.

## The Core Claim

Any system with (1) finite behavioral structure, (2) identifiable observations,
and (3) a sound oracle admits faithful extraction of a projected behavioral model
via iterative refinement. With a sound oracle the extracted model is
simulation-equivalent to the original over relevant states; with a complete
oracle the relationship upgrades to bisimulation.

"Finite behavioral structure" means the observation space is finite —
`[Fintype Dim]`. This does NOT mean finitely many states. A terminal emulator
has an infinite state space (the screen buffer), but finitely many behavioral
distinctions (the escape sequence parser operates over finitely many modes and
control characters). `[Fintype Dim]` bounds the observation space, not the
system's reachable state space.

## Structure of This File

1. `ObservableSystem` — base structure: relevant states, behavior relation,
   observation function
2. `LearnabilityPreconditions` — identifiable + sound oracle
3. Refinement machinery: `project`, `projectedOracle`, `refineStep`
4. Monotone stabilization: self-contained proof of `inflationary_stabilizes_bound`
5. `extraction_exists` — fixpoint gives soundness + controllability
6. `extraction_with_projection` — names the extracted π and R explicitly
7. `LearnabilityPreconditionsComplete` — adds `complete` + `relevant_closed`
8. `exact_extraction` — complete oracle gives soundness + controllability + injectivity
9. `relevantProjectedOracle`, `relevantProjectedOracle_witness_eq` —
   relevance-restricted oracle enabling reverse direction
10. Named constructions (sound-only): `extractionDims`,
    `extractionDims_each_dim_witnessed` — concrete fixpoint with certificates
11. Named constructions (complete): `refineStepComplete`, `extractionDims` (complete
    case), `extractionDims_deproject`, `extractionDims_each_dim_witnessed` (complete)

## Three Explicit Preconditions (Plus One Implicit)

The Lean types capture three explicit preconditions:

**1. Finite behavioral structure**: `[Fintype Dim]` — the observation space has
finitely many dimensions. Combined with `[DecidableEq Dim]`, this makes
`refineStep` compute a well-defined `Finset` and ensures
`inflationary_stabilizes_bound` terminates in at most `Fintype.card Dim`
iterations.

**2. Identifiability**: `identifiable` — the observation function
`observe : State → Dim → Value` distinguishes all relevant states. Two states
with identical observations across all dimensions must be the same state. In
practice this is near-trivial for concrete computational objects: for any
`DecidableEq State`, using the identity as the observation function satisfies
identifiability. The interesting question is not whether identifiability holds
but which dimensions are *needed* — that is what `refineStep` discovers.

**3. Sound oracle**: `oracle` + `sound` — every real behavior `behavior s ℓ s'`
has an oracle witness `oracle ℓ s s'`. In the symex instantiation, KLEE (or
similar) plays this role. Symbolic execution runs a program on symbolic inputs
rather than concrete ones, exploring all execution paths and collecting the
logical conditions (path conditions) under which each path is taken. This
yields oracle witnesses for all reachable behaviors. This is the non-trivial
precondition in practice — building the oracle requires engineering.

**Fourth implicit precondition (not in the Lean types): Effective observability.**
The oracle must be *productive*: given an incorrect candidate dimension set X,
the oracle finds a distinguishing witness pair rather than returning ⊥ forever.

In the OGIS framework (Jha & Seshia, *Acta Informatica* 2018), this is the
"productive q_ce oracle" property: a counterexample query oracle that eventually
returns a counterexample on incorrect hypotheses, even though it may return ⊥ on
any individual query. Symbolic execution is naturally such an oracle — sound but
partial (may time out or exhaust paths on any single query).

Effective observability holds when three conditions align:

- The implementation has a **reducible control-flow graph** (standard for
  compiled C; necessary for program dependence graph construction).
- Decision points have **thin semantic backward slices** — branch conditions
  depend on few variables, making path conditions tractable.
- Path conditions fall in a **decidable theory**: QF_BV (quantifier-free
  bitvector arithmetic, decidable via SAT reduction), linear arithmetic
  (also decidable), but not nonlinear integer arithmetic (undecidable).

The Lean types say `noncomputable` + `Classical` for `refineStep` and
`extractionDims` precisely because effective observability is not yet formalized:
classical logic witnesses the existence of distinguishing pairs without
constructing them. Formalizing when the oracle is productive is an open problem —
it is what this research program is working toward.

## Controllability and Separability Are Derived, Not Assumed

Two properties that might look like additional preconditions are in fact
*consequences* of the fixpoint:

- **Controllability**: states with the same projection have the same behavior
  availability (`extraction_exists` proves this at the fixpoint).
- **Injectivity** (separability): the projection is injective on relevant states
  (`exact_extraction`, `extractionDims_injective` — complete oracle case only).

The fixpoint argument for controllability: if two relevant states have the same
X-projection but different behavior availability, `refineStep` would add a
distinguishing dimension — contradicting fixpoint. These properties emerge from
identifiability + fixpoint; they are not inputs.

## Refinement Mechanics

`refineStep sys X` produces the next dimension set by adding every dimension `d`
that witnesses a non-controllability disagreement at the current projection X:

```
X ∪ {d | ∃ s₁ s₂ ℓ, relevant s₁ ∧ s₁ can take ℓ ∧
                    s₂ has the same X-projection as s₁ ∧
                    s₂ cannot take ℓ ∧
                    s₁ and s₂ differ at d}
```

Path-condition reading: "find two situations the current model conflates (same
X-projection) but that behave differently (one can take ℓ, the other cannot), and
add the dimension that distinguishes them." Each added dimension corresponds to a
path condition separating these states.

Non-circularity: the oracle witnesses are drawn from actual `State` values, not
from the projected `Dim → Value` space. What dimensions matter is discovered
from the full state space, independent of which dimensions X currently tracks.

## Convergence and Complexity

`inflationary_stabilizes_bound` proves that `refineStep` terminates in at most
`Fintype.card Dim` iterations: the operator is inflationary (only adds dimensions),
and the cardinality strictly increases with each non-fixpoint step, bounded by
`|Dim|`. Translated to oracle calls: extraction costs O(|Dim| × oracle_cost).

**Finding a fixpoint is tractable. Finding the *minimum* fixpoint is NP-hard.**

The dimension set `extractionDims` is *a* faithful fixpoint — not necessarily the
minimum one. Every tracked dimension has a concrete certificate of necessity
(`extractionDims_each_dim_witnessed`): it was added because specific states
(s₁, s₂) and label ℓ demonstrated its necessity at some refinement step k. But a
smaller fixpoint may exist that also distinguishes all relevant behaviors.

This is not a deficiency — it is provably optimal *not* to claim minimality.
Finding the minimum faithful dimension set is NP-hard by reduction from minimum
set cover (Jha & Seshia 2018, Theorem 6.1). Behavioral distinctions map to the
elements to be covered; dimensions map to sets; a minimum faithful dimension set
is a minimum cover. `refineStep` finds a valid fixpoint greedily, not an optimal
one.

The number of refinement iterations is lower-bounded by the teaching dimension TD
of the concept class (Goldman & Kearns 1995; Jha & Seshia Theorem 6.2: M_OGIS ≥
TD). Together with `inflationary_stabilizes_bound`:

```
TD(concept class) ≤ actual iterations ≤ Fintype.card Dim
```

## Two Extraction Modes

**Sound oracle only — `LearnabilityPreconditions`:** Yields soundness and
controllability at the fixpoint. In the LTS instantiation (via
`ConditionalSimulation.lean`), this gives forward simulation: G' simulates H_I
over relevant states.

**Complete oracle — `LearnabilityPreconditionsComplete`:** Additionally requires
`complete` (oracle witness → real behavior) and `relevant_closed` (behavior
preserves relevance). Uses `refineStepComplete`, which adds dimensions both for
non-controllability disagreements and for relevant-state observation disagreements.
At this fixpoint, the projection is injective on relevant states. Combined with
`relevantProjectedOracle` and `extractionDims_deproject`, this gives the reverse
simulation direction, assembling to bisimulation. See `CoinductiveBisimulation.lean`
for the assembled proof.

## Seven Target Domains

The framework handles any `behavior : State → Label → State → Prop` — the fields
need not represent state transitions:

1. **Operational semantics** (LTS): clean fit. `behavior = step`,
   `relevant = Reachable`. Path conditions from symex separate control-flow
   distinctions directly. This is the primary instantiation in the project.

2. **Parsing / recursive descent parsers**: `behavior` captures parse derivations.
   The implementation complexity (stack manipulation, lookahead) hides the grammar
   structure that `refineStep` recovers.

3. **Terminal emulation**: escape sequence processing as an LTS. Infinite screen
   state space, finitely many escape sequence modes — `[Fintype Dim]` captures the
   finite behavioral structure.

4. **Type systems**: `behavior` captures typing judgments (Γ ⊢ e : τ), not state
   transitions. `State := (Context × Expr)`, `Label := TypeRule` (which typing rule
   applies), `behavior (Γ, e) rule (Γ', e')` means applying `rule` in context Γ to
   expression e yields context Γ' and subexpression e'. `Dim` ranges over context
   shapes — the finite set of relevant context distinctions (e.g., "is variable x
   bound?", "what is the type of variable y?"). No initial state — judgments stand
   alone, so `relevant` filters to well-formed `(Γ, e)` pairs rather than marking
   reachable states. Identifiability is trivially `DecidableEq` on `(Context × Expr)`.
   Finitely many type rules and context shapes give `[Fintype Dim]`.

5. **Effect systems**: `behavior` captures effect propagation constraints, not state
   transitions. `State := (EffectContext × Computation)`, `Label := EffectOperation`
   (which effect operation is performed), `behavior (ε, c) op (ε', c')` means
   performing operation `op` in effect context ε on computation c yields ε' and c'.
   `Dim` ranges over effect annotations — the finite set of effect distinctions
   tracked by the system (e.g., "does this computation perform IO?", "is this
   handler installed?"). Effect annotations propagate through the type system, not
   through state transitions — a genuinely different mechanism from LTS, but
   `ObservableSystem` handles it because `behavior` is just a relation on states.

6. **Effect handler operational semantics**: a clean LTS — in contrast to #5,
   which is not an LTS. The effect annotation system and its operational semantics
   live in different categories despite describing the same language feature.

7. **Module systems / namespace resolution**: binding and resolution relations.
   Less developed as a target domain.

The non-LTS examples (#4, #5) sharpen the generality claim. `ObservableSystem`'s
`behavior : State → Label → State → Prop` doesn't care whether the relation
represents transitions, judgments, or constraint propagation.

**Framework power is proportional to implementation opacity.** When the behavior
structure is directly readable from the binary, no extraction is needed. When the
grammar or semantics is buried in control flow — as in recursive descent parsers
or terminal emulators — `refineStep` pays for itself.

## Relation to Convergence.lean and ConditionalSimulation.lean

Those files implement the same technique for the specific LTS case:
`CoRefinementProcess` iterates dimension refinement operationally, and
`simulation_at_coRefinement_fixpoint` gives the forward simulation result.
The present file is more general (any `ObservableSystem`), more declarative
(existence of a fixpoint rather than construction), and more complete (bisimulation
via the complete oracle case). The two developments are bridged in `LearnabilityConvergence.lean`:
any `LearnabilityPreconditions` instance gives rise to a `CoRefinementProcess`,
and `extractionDims` is a valid co-refinement fixpoint.

analysis including the implicit fourth (effective observability).
-/

/-- Learnability preconditions for semantic extraction.

    Any observable system satisfying these conditions admits extraction
    of an identifiable projected model via iterative refinement.

    Three explicit preconditions:
    1. **Finite behavioral structure**: `[Fintype Dim]` — the observation
       space is finite (typeclass, not a field — shared with `ObservableSystem`)
    2. **Identifiability**: `identifiable` — observations distinguish
       relevant states (injective on relevant states, unconstrained on s₂)
    3. **Sound oracle**: `oracle` + `sound` — every real behavior has an
       oracle witness

    Controllability (same projection → same behavior availability) and
    injectivity (projection injective on relevant states) are *derived*
    at the refinement fixpoint, not assumed. See `extraction_exists` and
    `exact_extraction`.

    The abstract statement covers any system expressible as
    State → Label → State → Prop; instantiating the preconditions
    for domains beyond operational semantics may be non-trivial. -/

/-! ## Identifiability Theorems

The `identifiable` precondition — observations distinguish relevant states —
is near-trivially satisfiable for concrete computational objects. These
theorems make that precise.

**What this discharges and what it doesn't.** Identifiability is the *easy*
precondition. For any system with decidable state equality (programs on x86,
ARM, any concrete ISA), these theorems give you identifiability for free.
The *hard* preconditions — constructing a sound oracle (requires symbolic
execution or equivalent) and achieving effective observability (the fourth
implicit precondition: choosing *what* to observe, building instrumentation
harnesses, computing the right program slice) — are not addressed here.
The framework guarantees convergence *if* you solve those problems; these
theorems just ensure identifiability won't be the bottleneck.
-/

/-- Globally injective observation implies identifiability.

    If `observe`, viewed as a function `State → (Dim → Value)`, is injective,
    then the `identifiable` precondition holds for any `relevant` predicate.

    Relevance is unused — global injectivity is stronger than the precondition
    requires. The precondition only constrains `relevant s₁` (with `s₂`
    unconstrained), so an observation function may conflate irrelevant states
    with each other, as long as no irrelevant state is observationally
    identical to a relevant one. -/

    Two states with identical fingerprints must be equal. -/

  simp at h₁
  exact h₁.symm

/-- Identifiability for `DecidableEq` types via the indicator observation.

    Corollary of `identifiable_of_injective_observe` applied to
    `indicator_observe_injective`. For any concrete computational type
    with decidable equality — `State := (Stack × Heap × Registers)`,
    `State := (Context × Expr)`, etc. — identifiability is trivially
    satisfiable using `Dim := State`, `Value := Bool`,
    `observe s d := decide (s = d)`.

    This proves identifiability is *satisfiable*, not that the indicator
    observation is the right one to use. In practice, the choice of
    observation function determines the quality of the extracted model —
    a natural observation like register/memory reads on an ISA gives a
    meaningful model, while the indicator construction only witnesses
    existence. The hard work is choosing observations that make effective
    observability achievable.

    Note: using this as an `identifiable` field in `LearnabilityPreconditions`
    also requires `[Fintype State]`, since the framework needs `[Fintype Dim]`
    and here `Dim = State`. -/

/-! ## Main Learnability Theorems

The central result is `extraction_exists`: given an `ObservableSystem` with
identifiable observations and a sound oracle, iterative refinement produces a
dimension set at which the projected oracle is sound and all behavior is
controllable. Everything else in this file either builds toward this theorem
or extends it (complete oracle, named constructions, certificates). -/

/-! ## Exact Extraction (Complete Oracle)

With a complete oracle, extraction yields an exact model: the projection
is injective on relevant states, giving bisimulation. -/

/-- Learnability preconditions with a complete oracle.
    Together with `sound`, completeness makes the oracle biconditional
    with the behavior relation on all states.

    Note: `exact_extraction` below does not use `complete` or
    `relevant_closed` — it proves soundness, controllability, and
    injectivity from `identifiable` + `sound` alone. These fields are
    present for downstream bisimulation construction, which requires
    completeness to go from projected oracle claims back to real
    behavior, and relevant closure to thread relevance through
    multi-step simulation. -/

/-- With a complete oracle, extraction yields an exact model:
    the projection is injective on relevant states. Combined with
    a relevance-restricted oracle and `relevant_closed`, this gives
    bisimulation (see `CoinductiveBisimulation.lean`).

    The proof only uses `identifiable` and `sound` from the parent
    structure — `complete` and `relevant_closed` are not needed for
    the three properties proved here (soundness, controllability,
    injectivity are all earned before completeness enters). Completeness
    becomes necessary only downstream, when the reverse simulation
    direction needs to go from a projected oracle claim back to real
    behavior (`extractionDims_deproject`).

    The proof uses a combined refinement step that tracks both
    non-controllability disagreements (as in `extraction_exists`) and
    observation disagreements among relevant states. At fixpoint,
    identifiable + no disagreements → injective on relevant states,
    and the non-controllability argument gives controllability. -/

set is a named `def`, and every tracked dimension carries a concrete
certificate of necessity.

which dimensions matter, starting from nothing. -/

/-! ## Extraction at Arbitrary Fixpoints

`extraction_exists` proves properties at the specific fixpoint discovered by
iterating `refineStep` from `∅`. But its proof only uses the fixpoint property
`refineStep X = X`, not how X was constructed. This factored version works for
ANY fixpoint. -/
